Fried rice that actually tasted ok

1 Pouch (1 lb?) Costco boneless skinless chicken thighs. Marinated and chopped.
2 Bunches of green onions. Q&A'd and chopped.
1 onion chopped kinda' fine.
1 jam jar of frozen peas & carrots.
Leftover pack of edamame. (optional, rather not.)
6 eggs, beaten a bit. Salt & pepper added.
1 cup of rice (Basmati) cooked then cooled. (Used the freezer)
Soy sauce.

Rice:
Little olive oil in pot.1 tsp to 1 tbl?
Salt, about 1/2 tsp?
1 cup rice.
Heat the pot stir the rice to coat in the oil. 'Till it's getting hot.
Add 2 cups water.
Bring to low boil..
Cover! 
Reduce the heat to low if on a "real" stove. 1/2 power on silly electric tabletop thing.
15 minutes. Then turn off stove. DO NOT UNCOVER. 15 more minutes. Open and fluf rice.
Now put the rice in fridge or freezer to cool. Depending on how much of a hurry you are in.

Chicken:
Drop all the thighs into a ziplock bag.
Add.. 
About 1 tsp of red wine vinegar.
Few shakes of soy sauce.
Couple hand grabs of sugar.
Big 'ol squirt of sriracha chili sauce.
Roll the bag up from the bottom to get the air out. Seal it up. Squish it about to mix and drop it in the fridge.

When the time comes to make the dish:

Heat the skillet. Dump in about 2 handfuls of the chopped green onions. Get them trying.
Next is the chicken. Either you chopped it up in bite size pieces before marination. So you can just plunk it in the skillet. Or chop it up now. Then pluck it all in the skillet. Fry 'till it's about.. 1/2 done.
Add the chopped onions. And another handful of the green onions.
Fry 'till the onions are getting clear.
Add in the jar of peas & carrots. Oh and the edamame. If you're doing that.
Get these at least warm..
Dump in the eggs.
And another handful of chopped green onions.
Scramble 'till the eggs are done.
Grab the rice out of the fridge and dump it in.
And another handful of chopped green onions.
Mix this all in.
Soy sauce to taste.
Dump in the rest of the chopped green onions.
Final mixing.

Serve!
