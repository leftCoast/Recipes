Pumpkin pie from Food Wishes (Chef John)

Preheat oven 425

1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree
3 egg yolks
1 egg
1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk 
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1/2 tsp fine salt
1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
1/8 tsp Chinese 5-spice powder
1 9-inch unbaked pie crust.

Bake 425 - 15 min
Bake 350 - 30..40 min ('Till knife comes out clean 1" from edge.)

Did the knife thing, came out clean 1" in from edge. Let it cool and the center was liquid. Need more time? Less temp with more time?
