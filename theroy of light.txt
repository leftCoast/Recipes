A theory just came to me a couple days ago watching Star talk and Feynman stuff.

This pieces I got.

• Light has no mass. 
• Light (must) travel at the speed of light. It seems to be some sort of built in limit.
• From light's point of view, it instantly crosses the universe 'till it impacts and is absorbed my something.
• Electrons have a tiny mass, and are negatively charged.
• Antimatter exists. It's been found in them collider things and documented. (Positrons)
• Positrons are just like electrons, but have negative mass and go backwards in time?

So fitting these pieces together I get.

>> A photon is just an electron/positron pair. Somehow linked together.
>> The masses of this pair cancel out. So IT HAS NO MASS.
>> The forward movement of the electron through time is canceled out by the backward movement through time of the positron. So for it, TIME STOPS.
>> As time goes to zero, for them, their velocity goes to infinity.
>> "But they must annihilate  each other." - They do! Instantly, when the hit something.
>> As WE observe them, they are limited to the speed of light. (Don't know why)

What is frequency of light?
My guess is that photons may come in packets, more than one pair at a time. The larger the packet of e/p pairs, the higher the frequency. Hence, the more powerful the energy for higher frequency larger more unstable packets.

I know this may sound flat-earth-ish, but it seemed to fit so many of the pieces together.
