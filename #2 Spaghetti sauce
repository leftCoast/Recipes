#2 Spaghetti sauce
Traditional from my family.

Large pot :
Dump 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, chop em up a bunch.
2 cans tomato sauce,
2 cans tomato paste(small cans)
Crush in clove of garlic.

Pan :
Fry up..
2 lbs hot Italian sausage
2 lbs hamburger Till brown.
Drain oils/juice into bowl with strainer. 
Dump meat into sauce.

Next..
Dump about a tablespoon or.. 2 of the meat juice back into the pan. Then add..

2 onions chopped up.
2 containers of sliced mushrooms.
chili powder to Taste.
Cayenne to heat it up if you want. 
Salt & pepper to taste.
A little bit of Soy sauce. Or not..

Start frying this up.
Once it's nearly done. Add in..
1 clove of garlic

Fry for about a minute more then..
Dump it all into sauce.

And there you go.


NOTES : 
Try adding 3-6 hand pinches (fingers and thumb) of sugar. Seems to help the taste. Test after each addition.

Also added a little beef broth. 1/4 cup? maybe less. Seemed to give it a more "complex" flavor. Tasted really good.
