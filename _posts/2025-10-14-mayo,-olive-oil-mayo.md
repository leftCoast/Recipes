title:  "Mayo, Olive Oil Mayo"
---

1 tsp salt
2 1/2 tsp sugar
1 1/2 tsp fresh squeezed lemon juice
1 tsp white wine vinegar
1/2 tsp dijon mustard
2 egg yolks
1 1/2 cup olive oil.- Bertolli Extra light taste.

Add everything but the oil into the stand mixer. Put in a whisk and get it running on high. Now you can add the olive oil one tablespoon at a time by pouring it around the rim of the bowl. This spreads out the oil around the rim slowing it down enough to not break the sauce.

Seemingly pointless. But actually very important step. Once all the oil is added and you have a nice blob of mayo in the bottom. Shut down the mixer, and with a flexible spatula, scrape all the sides down into the bottom of the blob. Now, fire up the mixer again for about 30 sec. to mix all the scrapings in. This does a great job of lengthening the shelf life of the finished product.

DO NOT TRY USING EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL. It'll just taste bitter. If you use the Extra light taste stuff it comes out almost tasting like butter. Very mild Mayo.
