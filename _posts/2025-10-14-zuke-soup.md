Part 1 Prep.

Buy a box of pre chopped mushrooms.

Part 2 Sauté first batch.
Grab sauté pan, pour in olive oil to cover bottom. Get the oil HOT. Add salt n pepper. Start sautéing the potatoes.

Once the potatoes are about 1/2 way done add the carrots.

As this cooks taste test and add salt and pepper as necessary.

When the potatoes are beginning to brown, add a couple handfuls of green onions.

Potatoes brown, carrots brown, green onions going clear. Move everything into a strainer over something to catch the drippings.

Part three Sauté the zucchinis.

Add more oil to the pan, get it HOT again.

Dump in the zucchinis and add salt n pepper to taste. Sauté these 'till they start to get brown.At this time add in a couple handfuls of green onions. Add back in the drippings from the initial potato and carrots.

Zucchinis turning brown, green onions going clear. Add chicken broth to deglaze and start dissolving the zucchinis.

Part three combine
Dump both batches of sautéed veg into a soup pot. Add more chicken broth, bring to boil. Check and adjust salt n pepper.

Last sauté
Pour some more oil in the pan. Get it HOT. Add salt n pepper. Dump in the onions get them sautéing. Once they are getting clear, add in the sliced mushrooms. Adjust salt n pepper. Once the mushrooms are getting brown, add in a couple handful of green onions.

While doing this...

Grab hand blender and start blending the stuff in the sauce pan into a kind of liquid. Dump in about a cup of milk. Keep blending 'till its a one smooth saucy thing. Let it boil on low for a bit. Don't let it burn.

When the mushrooms are done, add them in. Garnish with Parmesan cheese.

Enjoy!
