You can cut up a chicken and brine the parts. Buy the parts you want, and brine them. Buy the parts and skip the brining all together.

So brining is optional. If you choose to brine, then take the chicken pieces and soak 'em for.. I did an hour. (See chicken brine recipe here in notes.)

Dry: - Good for about 1 1/2 chicken.
In a large Tupperware with a lid add..
2 cups flour
2 1/2 tsp salt
1 tbl spice - see readme.

Egg wash - Actually ok for 2+ chickens.
1 cup milk
4 eggs
3/4 tsp salt

Dip in egg wash, dump in powder container, cover & shake, set aside to "rest". I don't know why you need to rest them.

You can fry 4 pieces per set. Two per basket.

Fry 350 for..
Thighs - 13 min. Came out about right.
Breast - Try about 12 min.
Giant breast & thighs - 16 minutes. No baskets just put them in the tank.

NOTE : This method also works great for prawns. There should be a reduced amount KFC prawn recipe some where around here as well.
