Guilt free lemon ice tea cooler.

Make up a picture of sun tea. 3..4 Lipton's tea bags.

Squeeze one lemon and pour in the juice. (Or, if making mayo, the remainder of the juice.)

Chill in fridge.

Take large glass fill about 1/4..1/3 full with the ice tea mix. Then top off with chilled water.

Makes for a very good thirst quencher.
