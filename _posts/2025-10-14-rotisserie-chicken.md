Rotisserie chicken

This is for doing a chicken in our rotisserie machine.

Get whole chicken.
Cover it entirely with Cajun seasoning powder. Shake it all over. And inside!
Maybe salt & pepper? Maybe not.
Jam the chicken, butt down, onto the rotisserie post.
Tuck the wings under the legs. Or else they may hang up on the walls.

1:15 @ 400 degrees, let'er rip!

Easy peasy!
