Bean-biliah

Do the brining bean thing. (2 quarts, 2 cups, 2 tbl)
Chop up about 1 lb each chicken thighs, and sausages.
Chop up about one large onion, 2 paseo peppers, 2 celery sticks, one large carrot, about 1/4 cup pickled jalape√±o peppers, and some tomatoes. I did 3 campari tomatoes..

Start with a Dutch oven, some olive oil, and get the sausages frying up. When they are done, put them aside in a colander over a bowl. You want the drippings.

Next drop in a pack(1 lb) hot chicken Italian sausage. Same thing, fry 'till done. Remove and add to the colander.

In to all these sausage drippings, add those from the colander as well. Now, fry up the chicken thighs. To these add salt, pepper, a little sage and a bunch of Cajun seasoning. Oh, and a little cayenne pepper too.

Once the chicken is done, add it to the colander with the sausage meat. Drippings back in Dutch oven. Now all the veggies, minus the tomato bits, go in to be fried up adding salt, pepper and cajun seasoning as taste warrants. Fry 'till onions are getting clear.

Now this time I added in the tomato chunks and all the meat into the pot along with the beans, 1/2 left over jar of pizza tomato sauce, a box of chicken stock and enough water to cover all. Boil, cover, simmer on low for 1 /1/2 hours.

Added a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar to mellow it down some. Next day, delicious.

Seriously! Julie liked it so much she forbid me from giving the leftovers to Tycho.

It's a couple days later. I'm snacking on it some, and yes, it still tastes delicious.
