Can be made gluten free.

Allie says tiny bit more sugar
Kim says use quick oats. (softer)

1 1/2 cups flour
3/4 cup brown sugar
1/2 cup white sugar
1 tsp baking soda
1 tsp cinnamon
1/2 tsp salt
Whisk together

2/3 cup olive oil
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla

Mix

3 cups oats
And extras

Mix

350 deg 8..10 minutes

NOTE : You need to mash 'em down a little so that they'll cook through. Left as balls of dough they tend to be a bit raw in the middle.
