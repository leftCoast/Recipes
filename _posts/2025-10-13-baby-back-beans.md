title:  "Baby back beans"
---

We had a party coming up and I wanted to make something like pork n beans. Julie went out to find pork for me but didn't have much luck. She did find a rack of baby back ribs. Lord, what to do with these?

### Ingredients

*   1 tsp pepper.
*   1 tsp dried thyme.
*   1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. Omit if using Fresno peppers.
*   1 tsp chili powder.
*   A healthy squirt of olive oil for frying.
*   3/4..1/2 lb Andouille sausage chopped/diced.
*   A full rack of individual baby back ribs.
*   1 onion.
*   1 paseo pepper.
*   1 red sweet pepper.
*   2 sticks of celery.
*   2 jalapeño peppers.
*   1 Fresno pepper. (main heat source)
*   2..3 bay leaves.
*   2/3 cup of Buddies sweet hot BBQ sauce.
*   4 tbl brown sugar.

### Instructions

1.  Do the overnight brining of beans thing - See readme.
2.  In Dutch oven, get the pot hot then add the pepper, dried thyme, cayenne pepper, chili powder, and a healthy squirt of olive oil for frying.
3.  Add the Andouille sausage chopped/diced. Fry up the sausage to let out it's oils.
4.  Once the andouille sausage is done, remove into a bowl and set aside.
5.  Into the flavored hot oil add a full rack of individual baby back ribs. Add salt to taste.
6.  Flip them about to get a bit of browning on all sides.
7.  Once the ribs are done, remove into a bowl and set aside.
8.  Chop 1 onion, 1 paseo pepper, 1 red sweet pepper, 2 sticks of celery, 2 jalapeño peppers, and 1 Fresno pepper.
9.  Dump the veggies into the flavored oil. Fry them up. Adding salt & pepper to taste.
10. When they are done frying, rinse the beans. Add them to the pot along with the ribs (And drippings!). NOT the sausage! Any accumulated drippings from the sausage need to go in though.
11. Add enough water to cover the beans and ribs. Add 2..3 bay leaves.
12. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce to low and let it simmer away for 1 hour.
13. One hour later, add back in the sausage & drippings. Add 2/3 cup of Buddies sweet hot BBQ sauce and 4 tbl brown sugar. Pull out the bay leaves.
14. Back simmering, covered on low for 20 more minutes.
15. VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST skim off the fat now accumulated at the top. The fat will give it a bad harsh taste. And, it's not good for you anyway. You can let it sit overnight, or put it in the fridge for a couple hours and it'll congeal at the top as a layer of orange wax. Then it'll be easy to scrape out and toss.
16. Rewarm the mixture, salt to taste and serve with slotted spoon.

### Notes
Tried this at a party. People were avoiding it for a bit, it was kinda' different. Finally, probably just to be polite, someone tried it. They were all, "Oh! This is.. You gotta' try this!" More people started trying it. Pretty soon it turned into a feeding frenzy and it was all gone!

Enjoy!
