$75 Crab chowder

1/2 lb FRESH shelled crab meat.
And 2 Large Dungeness crabs

THE STOCK:
Have a crab feed, eat the two large crabs. Don't do the best job getting all the meat out. But, be sure to at least crack ALL the shells. Toss the shells and extra bits into a 6qt. Dutch oven.

Along with the crab shells goes..

1..2 carrots rough cut.
1..2 sticks celery rough cut
1 large yellow onion, rough cut
1 bulb garlic chopped in half, equator.
-or- Two forkfuls of minced garlic.
1 tbl spoon peppercorns.
Spritzer of Asian fish sauce.(or not)
1..2 Tsp salt. (I just shook some in)

Leave all the skins on everything. It'll look like a pot of garbage. Worry not!

Cover in water, bring to boil, cover reduce to low simmer and let it go for about 2 hours.

THE CHOWDER:

While the stock is simmering along prep..
1 large carrot chopped.
1 stick celery chopped.
3 LARGE potatoes cubed.
2..3 cloves garlic peeled.
-or- One forkful minced.
4..5 strips of bacon chopped.
1 medium to large onion chopped.
1..2 leftover ears of corn. <- best
-or- A can of corn.

When the stock is done, strain it out into a large pot. Dump all the solid bits into the trash. Then filter it. I actually used a paper towel in the strainer and that worked great.

Get the stock in the large pot boiling and add the cubed potatoes into it to get cooking.

To the now empty Dutch oven add the bacon and get it frying.

When the bacon is getting near done. Start slowly adding in the onions. You don't want to dump them all in at once and get a bunch of water cooling everything off at this point.

Once the inions are all in and getting clear, add in the chopped carrots and celery. You can just dump these in.

About now start ladling out spoonfuls of the stock into the veggie mixture to control the temp and give steam to cook the carrots and celery.

Mash the peeled garlic cloves and add them into this mixture. Also at this time, add a drained can of corn to the mixture. (or the fresh corn)

Keep ladling stock in as the mix thickens until the potatoes all well done. Make sure the stock is reduced by at least a third or more. To kick up the flavor.

By now the veggie mix should be very tasty and kind of in a thickish reduced goo.

When the potatoes are done, pour the stock and potatoes back into the Dutch oven combining everything.

Bring to a boil and dump in a pint carton of cream. Now, as the cream has cooled the soup, ladle out about a cup or so to mix with about four tablespoons of flour as thickener. Pour this back in.

Bring this all back to a boil then dump in the 1/2 lb of crab meat.

Serve with sprinkle of course shredded cheddar cheese on top with side of crusty french bread. 1/2 tuna sandwich and chilled red seedless grapes.

Tasty!
