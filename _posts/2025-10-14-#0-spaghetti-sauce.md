#0 Spaghetti sauce

See "Canless tomato sauce."

1..2 Med. onions chopped
About the same amount of sliced mushrooms.
1 Large clove of garlic.
1 a pound of chicken Italian sausage.
1 lb ground elk meat.

Drizzle olive oil in bottom of large fry pan. Get it hot.
Add sausage, break it up as you fry it. Remove from pan and set aside. keep liquid in pan.

Drizzle olive oil in pan.
Add elk meat, break it up as you fry it as well. Salt to taste.
Remove from pan and add it to the sausage.

Drizzle olive oil in pan.
Add the onions to the pan. Fry 'till starting to get translucent. Add oil if it gets too dry.

Add mushrooms to the pan and keep them moist and salted to taste.
If you can get any liquid out of the meat that's been set aside, add that in too.
When the mushrooms are done to your liking and most of the liquid has been boiled off, add back the meat and stir everything together. A couple teaspoons of chili powder goes well in this.

Now add everything from the frying pan into the completed tomato sauce. Stir it all together.

Use a shake or so of cayenne pepper to adjust the heat level to what you desire.
DO NOT CLEAN THE FRY PAN!

Fill the frypan about 3/4 of the way up with water. Add heavy drizzle of olive oil, large section of Garlic thinly sliced but left as one section. Add salt to taste. And maybe a shake of Oregano?

Bring this to a boil.

Once it's boiling, remove the garlic and put in your pasta.
When your pasta is done, reserve this liquid for subsequent batches.
