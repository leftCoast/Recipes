### Notes
The Cream cheese frosting from this list was designed for this cake.

Well I picked the apples. Made the Apple sauce. Baked the cake, created the icing and frosted the cake with it. And it turned out...

Kinda' bland. No way t tell that there was any apples in there. Not bad.. Just boring.
