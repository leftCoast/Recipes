Cream biscuits (BANNED)

#5 This version seems to be the ticket.

2 cups flour
1 tbl baking powder
1 tsp salt
1 tbl sugar
-Whisk it all up- then add..
1 tsp vanilla
1 1/2 c 30% whipping cream

Roll out the dough. Should make 10 3" round biscuits.

2..3 tbl melted butter (brush on top before n after cooking) limit one coat before, two coats afterward. Any more and they get kinda' heavy.

Bake (foil lined pan) at 450, 11 minutes?
Try 12 min next time, they seemed a tiny bit heavy. Possibly was the extra butter?

#2
Always burnt, try 9 min this time.
Looks like 8 1/2 minutes would be better. Did that by accident and they didn't burn.

#3
Added 2 tsp sugar & 1 tsp vanilla. Also used "Real" cream. Don't use real cream. Too damn thick with the solids. Not "wet" enough. Had to add extra. Use the "Regular" 30% Heavy whipping cream.

500 is just too hot for this oven. Raw middles and burnt bottoms. try 425 and maybe 9..10 min.
