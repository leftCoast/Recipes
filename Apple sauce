Apple sauce

Take about a grocery bag of home picked somewhat tart apples.
Fill 4 qt. sauce pan to overflowing with apple chunks.
About 1/2 cup water to prime the boiling.
Cook on low. 
Check and stir every 20 minutes or so 'till mostly done.

Then add..
1/2 cup brown sugar.
1/4 tsp nutmeg.
1/4 tsp cinnamon.
1 tsp vanilla.

Cook 'till desired doneness.

Turned out delicious!

NOTE : 9/20/25 - I cut the sugar & spices in half. I actually like it better that way. So, if you want it sweeter & spicier? Go ahead and bump up the values. Tasted good that way as well.
