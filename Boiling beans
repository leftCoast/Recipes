For most chili's and things that want beans added. This is my goto recipe.

The night before.. Do the brining beans thing. 2 cups Pink beans etc. - See readme.

Drain and rinse the beans

Chop up 1/2 lb boneless pork spare ribs.
-Or- 1 pork chop.
-Or- 1/2 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs.
Sprinkle some salt on whatever you choice is.

Get the pot heating up dry, Add..
1 tsp chili powder.
1/2 tsp cumin.
1 1/2 tsp salt.
1/4 tsp pepper.
Heat 'till you can tell the stuff is getting hot and you can just smell it just starting to bake.

Now add in a good drizzle of olive oil. When that gets hot..

Add 1 onion chopped up. Fry 'till getting clear.

Now add in the chopped up meat and brown it. Adding salt to taste.

Once all the meat, onions etc are done.

Add one bowl crushed of garlic. Let it all heat for a minute.

Now, Add 2 qt of water. With the drained and rinsed beans.

Add a 2 bay leaves.

Bring to a boil, cover, reduce to low and simmer for 1 1/2 hour.

Delicious!
